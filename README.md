# kivio-theme (An Apache Roller theme)
This is a simple theme for the [Apache Roller](http://roller.apache.org) blogging software based on a HTML 5 template based on *Unique Template* by [WebThemez.com](http://webthemez.com).

## Usage
Put this folder into Roller's template directory _themes_ or if you have changed the directory via *roller-custom.properties* put it there:
```
...
themes.dir=/opt/roller
```

## Missing features
Currently the template is not complete to compete with the templates delivered with Apache Roller or from roller-extras. This list tells what is missing:

*	archives.vm: Calendar browser and links to latest entries	
*	search.vm: Search results page
*	tags_index.vm: Tag index page
*	Missing screenshot as preview on template selection
